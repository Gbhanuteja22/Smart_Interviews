Powerful Subsets 
Given an array A, check if there is any subset of array A in which if we do bitwise AND of all elements of that subset, the result is a power of two (1,2,4,8,16 and so on).

Input Format
The first line of input contains the total number of test cases. It is followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - size of array A and the next line contains N space-separated integers.

Output Format
For each test case, print "YES" if such a subset exists, otherwise print "NO", separated by a new line.

Constraints
50 points
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 15
0 <= arr[i] <= 109

150 points
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 109

Example
Input
3
3
1 2 3
2
10 20
5
5 20 11 14 15

Output
YES
NO
YES

Explanation
Test Case 1
The subset {2} gives AND result of 2, which is a power of 2. Also the subset {3,1} gives AND result of 1, which is a power of 2.

Test Case 3
The subset {5,14,15} gives AND result of 4, which is a power of 2.
