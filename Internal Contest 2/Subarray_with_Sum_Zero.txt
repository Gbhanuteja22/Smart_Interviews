Subarray with Sum Zero 
Given an array, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is 0.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It is followed by 2T lines. The first line of each test case contains N - size of the array. The second line contains N space separated integers - elements of the array.

Output Format
For each test case, print the length of the longest subarray whose sum is 0, separated by a newline.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
-1000 <= ar[i] <= 1000

70 points
1 <= T <= 500
1 <= N <= 10000
-1000 <= ar[i] <= 1000
