Sum of Subarrays
Given an array of integers, answer queries of the form: [i, j]: Print the sum of array elements from A[i] to A[j], both inclusive.

Input Format
The first line of input contains the N-size of the array. The next line contains N integers - elements of the array. The next line contains Q - number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains 2 space-separated indexes: i and j.

Output Format
For each query, print the sum of array elements from A[i] to A[j], both inclusive, separated by a new line.

Constraints
